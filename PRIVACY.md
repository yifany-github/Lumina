# Privacy Policy for Lumina - AI Bookmark Manager

**Last Updated: November 21, 2025**

Lumina ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the Lumina Chrome Extension.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or share your personal data on our servers.**

*   **Bookmarks**: The extension accesses your browser's bookmarks (`chrome.bookmarks`) solely to generate summaries and tags. This data is processed locally and sent directly to the Google Gemini API for analysis.
*   **API Keys**: Your Google Gemini API Key is stored locally in your browser's storage (`chrome.storage.local`). It is never sent to us or any third party other than Google (for the purpose of authentication with their API).
*   **AI Processing**: When the extension analyzes a bookmark, the content of that specific page is sent directly from your browser to Google's Gemini API. Google's handling of this data is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Google's Generative AI Terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai).

## 2. Data Storage

All data generated by Lumina (summaries, tags, embeddings) is stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local`. You have full control over this data and can clear it at any time via the extension's settings.

## 3. Third-Party Services

*   **Google Gemini API**: We use Google's Gemini API to provide AI summarization and search capabilities. Please refer to Google's documentation for details on how they handle API data.

## 4. User Consent

By using Lumina, you consent to the processing of your bookmark data as described in this policy.
